# The Romanian Language / Limba Română

## Foreword

Having struggled to find a list of useful resources to learn the Romanian
language and having been inspired by a fellow language learner,
[TheDomcio](https://github.com/TheDomcio), and his
[wonderful repository for the Polish language](https://github.com/TheDomcio/WonderfulPolishLanguage),
I decided to create a repository dedicated to the Romanian language.

I invite everybody and anybody to contribute to his and my own repository, and
to create one for other languages which do not yet have such a repository.

  - #### Briefing

    - Name: **Romanian** (previously also spelled **Rumanian** and
      **Roumanian**[French **roumain**]), also known as **Daco-Romanian** in
      comparative linguistics to help distinguish it from other Romanian
      languages ([Aromanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromanian_language),
      [Istro-Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istro-Romanian_language),
      [Megleno-Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megleno-Romanian_language)).

    † - The Italo-Celtic grouping of the
    [Italic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_languages) and
    [Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages) languages is
    disputed on the basis of disagreement on the causes of similarities between
